### Overview
<p style="clear: both;">
  <img src="../assets/images/fanpage.gif" width="200" class="syllabus-img">Fan pages were hallmarks of the early net. They represented a casual and spontaneous quality where users created ultra stylized environments to celebrate their interests. For this activity, I&rsquo;d like you to create a fan page for someone or something you deem deserving of the honor. Consider what qualities of the person/object are most visual and descriptive. Embrace the person/object and design a website that fully embodies their spirit. All assets on the site must be made by you (however, editing or collaging found assets in a meaningful way is OK).
  </p>
  The website should include a variety of content (text, images, videos, animation) to tell the clearest story. While we&rsquo;re looking to the past for this project conceptually, the design of the website should feel like it is from 2020 and designed with a contemporary design sensibility. The content of the site can be a mix of self-generated content and found content, as long as it&rsquo;s used with intention and interpreted in a new way.
  <p>
    You can also think of this project as a profile in a journalistic sense. It can be a person, place, thing, idea, but you should focus on one impression or detail about it rather than going too broad. Being specific will help us avoid &rdquo;book report syndrome.&ldquo; What persperctive can you bring in to your subject that only you have to offer?
