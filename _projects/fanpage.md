### Overview
<p style="clear: both;">
  <img src="../assets/images/fanpage.gif" width="200" class="syllabus-img">Fan pages were hallmarks of the early net. They represented a casual and spontaneous quality where users created ultra stylized environments to celebrate their interests. For this activity, I&rsquo;d like you to create a fan page for someone or something you deem deserving of the honor. Consider what qualities of the person/object are most visual and descriptive. Embrace the person/object and design a website that fully embodies their spirit. All assets on the site must be made by you (however, editing or collaging found assets in a meaningful way is OK).
  </p>
  The website should be contained to a single page, but you can think about what kinds of content (text, images, videos, animation) tell the clearest story. While we&rsquo;re looking to the past for this project conceptually, the design of the website should feel like it is from 2020 and designed with a contemporary design sensibility.
